So the problem is, that the Devs we have in Germany or generally in SCPSL Germany, are not soo... competently
If its okay for you, it would be a Plugin with some things in it.

It should be the Mainplugin of the Server (FL-Main)
Features would be: 

✔️ When the Warhead explodes, all Doors and Gates explode with it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✔️As soon as MTF/Chaos spawns, every light in the facility should flicker green or blue for 3sec.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kills and damage should be displayed for the SCPs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Buddysystem (If you want to play a role with a friend, you can easily send a request to your friend using .buddy (NAME). This person then receives a request and can accept it with .buddy accept.

Both come in the same role
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✔️At the end of the round, FriendlyFire should activate.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✔️ Endless Battery for the radios
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The elevators go up/down faster or slower, always completely randomly
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✔️Weapons deliveries for the Chaos/MTF. A delivery of weapons/ammunition arrives every 6 minutes. CASSIE then sends a message accordingly
(I'll leave it to you to decide which message arrives. It just shouldn't be too long and maybe contain an error)
